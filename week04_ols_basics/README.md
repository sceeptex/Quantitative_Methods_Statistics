# Learning Goals

1. Write Functions in R.
2. Fit bivariate OLS "by hand".
3. Learn about Residuals and Model Fit.
4. Use R Regression Commands.
5. Learn about Non-Linearities in Linear Models

In other words, our goals are to:

+ Manually estimate an OLS-Model
+ Calculate predicted values, residuals, R squared
+ Visualize results with some nice plots 
+ Learn how to let R do the work for you
