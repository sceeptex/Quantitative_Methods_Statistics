# Learning Goals

1. How to Construct Confidence Intervals
    1. Analytically
    2. Using Simulation
    3. Using Bootstrapping
2. What is the idea behind confidence intervals 
3. How to Estimate Difference in Means 

In other words, our goals are to:

+ Really understand what "statistical inference" means
+ Review how we can assess the uncertainty of the inferences we make
+ Learn about simulations, bootstrapping and classical hypothesis testing (and it's only the third session, we are making good progress!)
