Main library used: scikit-image (https://scikit-image.org/)

What is this Course about?
This course provides an introduction to theoretical and practical aspects of digital image analysis including the fundamentals of image formation, image representation and a broad range of basic image processing techniques and algorithms. The course explores different types of image representations, how to enhance image characteristics, image filtering and how to reduce the effects of noise in an image. It also introduces different methods used to extract features and objects in an image.

Course Learning Goals:
Upon successful completion of the requirements for this course, students will be familiar with basic image processing techniques for solving real problems. They will be able to describe the basic issues and scope of image processing and the role of image analysis in a variety of applications.

At the end of the course, students will be able to:

- describe fundamental concepts and techniques (e.g., Hough transforms, Fourier transforms) in image analysis. (CG1)
- implement solutions to real-world image analysis problems. (CG2)
- describe, evaluate and benchmark widely used image analysis algorithms. (CG3)
- use and extend existing functions and software packages (e.g., scikit-image) and develop their own code to automatically analyze images. (CG4)
